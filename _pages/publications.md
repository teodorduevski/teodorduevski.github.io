**ESG Incidents and Fundraising in Private Equity**<br>
(with Chhavi Rastogi and Tianhao Yao)

*Select Presentations*: Inquire Europe Fall Seminar (scheduled), 3th Oxford Sustainable Private Market Conference (scheduled), HEC-HKUST Sustainable Finance Seminar Series (scheduled), GRASFI (scheduled), 7th Annual Private Markets Research Conference, International Risk Forum.

*Abstract*: We present novel evidence on how environmental and social (E&S) incidents affect the
capital raising ability of Private Equity (PE) firms. Using a sample of global buyout investments,
we find that PE firms experiencing E&S incidents in their portfolio companies are
less likely to raise a subsequent fund and the subsequent funds are smaller. The relative size
of subsequent funds is 9%-12% smaller for PE firms experiencing above-median number of
E&S incidents. The decrease in capital commitment does not seem to be related to fund
performance, instead it is driven by E&S concerns of limited partners (LPs). LPs trade off
their E&S concerns with cost of divestment and as a result the impact of E&S incidents
is weaker for high reputation PE firms. PE firms relying on E&S-concerned LPs in turn
engage with their portfolio companies to manage E&S risk. The threat of “exit” by E&S
concerned investors incentivizes PE firms to exert “voice”.

**Exploration, Exploitation and Agency Issues in Venture Capital**<br>
(solo-authored, second year paper)

*Select Presentations*: Finance Theory Group Summer School, Rice - LEMMA Annual Conference, Aalto University, Entrepreneurship PhD Workshop, HEC Paris Brown Bag Seminar.

*Abstract*: I study the determinants of portfolio allocation decisions by venture capital (VC) firms.
I construct a dynamic agency model with an exploration versus exploitation trade off of a
VC firm raising capital for subsequent funds. The VC firm raises capital from a limited
partner (LP) and can allocate this capital to a known market (exploitation) or explore a
new market (exploration). The model features moral hazard between the general and limited
partners and learning from past investments by the VC firm. I endogenize the portfolio
allocation of the VC firm and the capital allocation of the limited partners. In the first best,
firms with high opportunity cost of exploration do not explore; firms that choose to explore,
base their allocation decision on the cost of managing the funds and their skill to learn from
past investments. The threat of divestment by limited partners alleviates the moral hazard
problem and can encourage exploration. Using Pitchbook data, I find evidence consistent with
the model. Based on newly created VC firm’s partners’ past experience, I construct a novel
opportunity cost of exploration measure and show that VC firms where the opportunity cost
of exploration is high are more specialized and perform better at their first fund’s investments.
Conditional on raising a follow up fund however, they grow less.
