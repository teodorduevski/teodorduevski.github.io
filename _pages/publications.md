*Main Presentations*: Inquire Europe Fall Seminar (scheduled), 3th Oxford Sustainable Private Market Conference (scheduled), HEC-HKUST Sustainable Finance Seminar Series (scheduled), GRASFI (scheduled), 7th Annual Private Markets Research Conference, International Risk Forum.

*Abstract*: We present novel evidence on how environmental and social (E&S) incidents affect the
capital raising ability of Private Equity (PE) firms. Using a sample of global buyout investments,
we find that PE firms experiencing E&S incidents in their portfolio companies are
less likely to raise a subsequent fund and the subsequent funds are smaller. The relative size
of subsequent funds is 9%-12% smaller for PE firms experiencing above-median number of
E&S incidents. The decrease in capital commitment does not seem to be related to fund
performance, instead it is driven by E&S concerns of limited partners (LPs). LPs trade off
their E&S concerns with cost of divestment and as a result the impact of E&S incidents
is weaker for high reputation PE firms. PE firms relying on E&S-concerned LPs in turn
engage with their portfolio companies to manage E&S risk. The threat of “exit” by E&S
concerned investors incentivizes PE firms to exert “voice”. 


**Exploration, Exploitation and Agency Issues in Venture Capital**<br>
(solo-authored, second year paper)

*Main Presentations*: Finance Theory Group Summer School, Rice - LEMMA Annual Conference, Aalto University, Entrepreneurship PhD Workshop, HEC Paris Brown Bag Seminar.

*Abstract*: I study the determinants of portfolio allocation decisions by venture capital (VC) firms.
I construct a dynamic agency model with an exploration versus exploitation trade off of a
VC firm raising capital for subsequent funds. The VC firm raises capital from a limited
partner (LP) and can allocate this capital to a known market (exploitation) or explore a
new market (exploration). The model features moral hazard between the general and limited
partners and learning from past investments by the VC firm. I endogenize the portfolio
allocation of the VC firm and the capital allocation of the limited partners. In the first best,
firms with high opportunity cost of exploration do not explore; firms that choose to explore,
base their allocation decision on the cost of managing the funds and their skill to learn from
past investments. The threat of divestment by limited partners alleviates the moral hazard
problem and can encourage exploration. Using Pitchbook data, I find evidence consistent with
the model. Based on newly created VC firm’s partners’ past experience, I construct a novel
opportunity cost of exploration measure and show that VC firms where the opportunity cost
of exploration is high are more specialized and perform better at their first fund’s investments.
Conditional on raising a follow up fund however, they grow less.

*Abstract*: In statistics, samples are drawn from a population in a data-generating process (DGP). Standard errors measure the uncertainty in estimates of population parameters. In science, evidence is generated to test hypotheses in an evidence-generating process (EGP). We claim that EGP variation across researchers adds uncertainty—nonstandard errors (NSEs). We study NSEs by letting 164 teams test the same hypotheses on the same data. NSEs turn out to be sizable, but smaller for more reproducible or higher rated research. Adding peer-review stages reduces NSEs. We further find that this type of uncertainty is underestimated by participants.

**Understanding detrimental and beneficial grain boundary effects in halide perovskites**<br> 
(Advanced Materials 30.52, 2018)<br> 
<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/adma.201804792" title="Publication Link" style="display: inline-block; padding: 3px 8px; font-size: 14px; color: black; background-color: #ffffff; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; border: 2px solid rgb(130, 0, 0); border-radius: 0px;">Journal Link</a>

*Abstract*: Grain boundaries play a key role in the performance of thin-film optoelectronic devices and yet their effect in halide perovskite materials is still not understood. The biggest factor limiting progress is the inability to identify grain boundaries. Noncrystallographic techniques can misidentify grain boundaries, leading to conflicting literature reports about their influence; however, the gold standard – electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) – destroys halide perovskite thin films. Here, this problem is solved by using a solid-state EBSD detector with 6000 times higher sensitivity than the traditional phosphor screen and camera. Correlating true grain size with photoluminescence lifetime, carrier diffusion length, and mobility shows that grain boundaries are not benign but have a recombination velocity of 1670 cm s−1, comparable to that of crystalline silicon. Amorphous grain boundaries are also observed that give rise to locally brighter photoluminescence intensity and longer lifetimes. This anomalous grain boundary character offers a possible explanation for the mysteriously long lifetime and record efficiency achieved in small grain halide perovskite thin films. It also suggests a new approach for passivating grain boundaries, independent of surface passivation, to lead to even better performance in optoelectronic devices.
